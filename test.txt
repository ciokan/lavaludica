Hand crafted and hand painted solid wood stool, small dimension.
The stool is is painstakingly created,with passion and patience, with the same method it was used hundreds of years before. It is carved with a chisel by a master craftsman and then hand-polished. After that, it is handed to a plastic artist who paints it with ethnic motifs inspired by Romanian folklore. This results in a 100% handmade product, imperfect but beautiful precisely because of its uniqueness. Important: because it is not a machine-made mass product, the stool can have small imperfections and the color and dimensions may vary slightly from that in the picture.
